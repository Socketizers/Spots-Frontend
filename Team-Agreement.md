## Conflict Plan
* **Create a healthy culture** : Treat everyone in the team fairly and equally, provide them with praise and recognition, and be open and honest at all times.
* **Learn to spot the early signs of conflict** : Take action early to help our team resolve the situation before it escalates.
* **Develop rules for handling conflict** :  Ensure team members listen to one another, respect each other’s points of view, and refrain from interrupting each other.
* **Repeat, Rephrase, Reflect** When someone would rather continue the conflict than resolve it, we need to be patient. One way to hold on is to repeat what they are saying, rephrase it in your own words to show you have heard and understood, and then invite the other person to join you as you reflect on the facts and circumstances of the case.
